# Printing something to the console
# If you leave something alone on a line that isn't a function, Powershell will assume you want to print it to the console
# If you want to explicitely tell it to print something, use write-host
"Hello world"
write-host "Hello world"
# The above two would both print "Hello world" to the console
# Normally there is no difference, however sometimes you need to use write-host
$thing = "World"
"Hello" $thing # This on its own throws an error
write-host "Hello" $thing # This prints Hello World
